  # The global bucket returns everything
  # Try to comment it and uncomment the by_user bucket
  # On the app the other users data should disappear (the inital seeded data is linked to a random user)
  # Note that changes to this file are not watched.
  # The container needs to be restarted for changes to take effect.

    data:

      - SELECT * FROM tasks
  # by_user:
  #   # Select parameters for the bucket, using the current user_id
  #   parameters: SELECT request.user_id() as user_id
  #   # Note: `request.user_id()` replaced the previous `token_parameters.user_id` syntax
  #   data:
  #     # Select data rows using the parameters above
  #     - SELECT * FROM people WHERE owner_id = bucket.user_id
