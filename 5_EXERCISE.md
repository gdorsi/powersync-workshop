# Post-walktrough exercise

Congratulations! You've completed the walkthrough!

You should now have a basic understanding of how PowerSync works.

Now we are going to do a quick exercise to let you have a better understanding of the concepts we've seen during the walkthrough.

In this exercise, we'll add a new feature to our app: requesting time off.

The `timeoffs` table is already set up for you and the backend should be already configured to handle the `timeoffs` table.

The goal of this exercise is to:
1. Modify the `AllocationForm` to let the user request time off
2. Show the requested timeoffs in the Schedule

As how to do it, you can use the Task as example.

Good luck!

## Extra Credit

Do you have extra time?

You can try to add the following features:

- Add the edit and delete functionality to the AddPersonForm
- Add the edit and delete functionality to the AllocationForm
- Add an approval workflow to the time off requests (since we don't have a real auth, we could make that the timeoff can be approved by anyone that is not the owner). This requires some changes to the DB.
